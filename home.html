		<p class="padding-top-10">Welcome all to our class website! Due to the unfortunate circumstances we find ourselves in, we will be using this website for our class. While I hope we can have at least one more in-person class before the end of the school year, I still am keen on making sure your kids get a great religious school education whatever the situation may be, and I think this is the best way to continue with that mission.</p>
		<p>I am still working on this website, so please check back every so often to see the changes I've made. I will try to make it as interactive as possible so your kids (and even you!) can have fun while learning. Please feel free to navigate throughout the website and let me know if you have any questions. Also, feel free to use this site during the week so your kids can practice! Have fun! </p>
