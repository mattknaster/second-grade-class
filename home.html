		<h3 class="green text-center padding-top-10">Welcome to Mr. Matt's 2nd Grade Online Class!</h3>
		<p class="padding-top-10">Welcome all to our class website! Due to the circumstances, we will be using this website for our class. While I hope we can have at least one more in-person class before the end of the school year, we will see what the situation is like and plan accordingly. For now, we will be using this site for our class. </p>
		<p>I will be adding new features to this website and posting weekly assignments for the kids to do so they still receive a quality religious school education. If I can, I will add a "Game Zone" for the kids to use so they can have fun with their learning and so we can continue the competitios we typically do in class! I will send out e-mails each week with instructions of what we will be learning, so please keep your eye out for those. And please feel free to use this site during the week as well to practice and learn! As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Have fun! </p>
