      <p style="color:purple"><i>Modeh Ani</i> is the first thing we say when we get up in the morning. According to Jewish tradition, one is supposed to jump out of bed like a mighty lion to show that we are prepared for whatever challenges await us. <i>Modeh Ani</i> means "how grateful am I," so we start off our day by counting our blessings and thanking God for giving us the chance to wake up and have a fun day. There is no better way to start the day than saying "thank you" to God! </p>
      <p style="color:purple">Homework assignment: For one week, try to list three things you are thankful for when you get up.

      <p>The <i>Barechu</i> is our "call to worship" prayer, which means that we are fully awake and ready to begin our service. The first part of the prayer is said by the rabbi or leader of the service, and the second part is said by the entire congregation. <i>Barechu </i> means both "bless" and "praise," and we are recognizing that all blessigs ultimately come from God. When you become a Bar/Bat Mitzvah, you will get to lead the congregation in this prayer when you are called to read from the Torah. This is also the prayer we say when we sing "Sweet as Honey." </p>
	<p>Question to think about: Why do we stand and bow when we say this prayer?</p>

      <h1 class="text-center">Shema (שְׁמַע) </h1>
      <p>The <i>Shema</i> is the most important prayer in Judaism. The word means "to listen," and in Judaism, there is a huge emphasis on listening, whether that be listening to parents, grandparents, teachers, friends, and God. In this prayer, we, the people of Israel, are recognizing that God is one, and that there is only one God. We also have the option of closing our eyes during this prayer so we can focus on saying the prayer.</p>
      <P>Homework assignment: Sit for 5-10 minutes for one week and just listen what is around you. Really focus on listening. </P>

      <p><i>Mi Chamocha</i> celebrates our freedom from Egypt and the successful crossing of the Red Sea. In this prayer, we are saying, "Who is like You, Adonai?" There is nothing in the entire universe that can be compared with God-- that is why we say that God is unique and special, because He cannot be compared to anything or anyone.</p>

      <p>As Jews, we are lucky to have a holiday every week! Shabbat is a time to relax, to put away the video games and shut off the TV and hang out with friends and family. Six days a week we are busy, whether we are at school or at work, so it's nice to have an entire day to kick back and relax. We say three blessings during Shabbat: one for the wine/grape juice, the challah, and the candles.</p>
